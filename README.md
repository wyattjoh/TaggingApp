The following project is an application for the Android mobile
phone. It is compatibile with the current version of Android and was
developed using Android version 16. The hardware used for testing the app 
was a Nexus 4. During development we used Eclipse and the Android SDK to 
create and test our program.

The tagging app is used to take photos and assign tags to the photos.
It currently features a persistent environment on the phone using Gson and 
saves user data onto their phones disc.
The application purpose is to tag objects and associate the objects tag with
a URL.

To run the software:
1) Install and set up the Android SDK Software for the Eclipse IDE
2) Import the TaggingApp project into Eclipse
3) Run the project using the Android emulator provided by SDK
